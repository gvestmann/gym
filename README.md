# gym-restaurant

This bootstrap website is actually based on a design I'm working on for another assignment at Vefsk√≥linn (the Figma one). From the start I wanted to base the project on something "real" instead of letting the Boostrap framework controlling the outcome. Sort of a "real-life" example. You can actually read a bit about the restaurant itself on the frontpage. 

The whole site is based on Bootstrap's grid system. I tried using as many standard classes as possible, for placement and such. I actually started using the margin classes Bootstrap provides, but quickly gave up on it since I found it a bit limiting and frustrating to work with (mainly because of my custom design.)

I did like working with the framework. It made basic layouting very easy and quick once you got the hang of it. In other ways, it was a bit limiting working with it to get the fine touches of my design. Obviously I did not use everything which Bootstrap has to offer - it has a bunch of handy features! I kept the Bootstrap JS script within the HTML even though I didn't utilize them at this point.

You can find commenting on the code in both HTML-files. I wrote the custom styles in SASS; that files is well organized for your view pleasures.

Bon appetit!
